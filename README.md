## Requirements

- node >=10

* Adjusted version of complete written tutorial to remove firebase project setup. We can assume they have a project setup already.

## Backend Overview

Let's to start out by going through a high level overview of how the backend will be setup. This overview will go over the types of functions we use as well as the actual code structure. 

### Types of Functions

The backend is built around the strengths that firebase poses in their serverless cloud functions setup. Focussing on those strengths we can break the system into two types of functions (could also be called a micro-service if you choose to). Reactive and RESTul

- **Reactive:** This is a function that will run in reaction to data or state updating on the backend. An example of this will be when a file is uploaded to cloud storage or the most common when a document / entry in the database has been updated.
- **RESTful:** This is the function that will run when the user makes an http request to the uri the function is assigned to. Nothing special about these ones. Just 1 note that's very important. This will not be used for single CRUD operations like adding a user, deleting a user, updating a user. And it's built with that in mind. This means you won't be able to define a single api endpoint for user that behaves differently based on the HTTP verb used. This is by design and won't be changed. All CRUD should be performed directly on your Firebase DB of choice. That's how this is supposed to be used. 

### Code structure

We have an enforced code structure that will help with the organisation of the backend as well as the overall maintenance as it grows. There's 3 major things to go over. 

1. **Each function will be in its own dedicated file:** This is to get rid of the "natural" tendency, when starting with firebase cloud functions, to keep adding functions into the same index file forcing it to grow bigger as your backend requirements grow. *The file name will be the exact name of the endpoint to keep things easy to manage. This is not a requirement but I've found it to be quite helpful*.
2. Functions will be placed in a folder titled either restful or reactive
3. The backend will be split into different resource groups to ensure a structured backend in production

## Code Setup

### Installation

We'll start off by installing the package dedicated to using this system `firebase-backend`. Install the package through npm

```powershell
npm install firebase-backend
```

### Configuration

Then you can open the index.ts file in your source folder and update it to 

```tsx
import { FunctionParser } from "firebase-backend";

exports = new FunctionParser(__dirname, exports).exports;
```

These are the two magical lines of code that allows us to dynamically add and export functions as the backend grows without ever changing the index file ðŸ¥³. And that's also all we need to set it up. Now we can start creating functions ðŸ˜Ž

### Creating an Http Endpoint

Lets start with something familiar. Creating a RESTful endpoint on our backend. We'll start by creating a folder (resource group) called `users`. In this folder we'll create another folder called `restful`. Then we'll create a new file called `addPaymentMethod.endpoint.ts`.  For any endpoint the file has to end in `.endpoint.ts` if it doesn't then it won't be loaded as an http endpoint. 

Inside that file we'll import `Request` and `Response` from express as well as `Endpoint` and `RequestType` from `firebase-backend`. Then we'll construct and export a new post endpoint with some made up logic.

```tsx
import { Request, Response } from 'express';
import { Endpoint, RequestType } from 'firebase-backend';

export default new Post(
  (request: Request, response: Response) => {
    // Read the values out of the body
    const cardNumber = request.body['card_number'];
    const cardHolder = request.body['card_holder']

    // Do your thing with the values
    var paymentToken = `${cardNumber}_${cardHolder}`;

    // Send your response. 201 to indicate the creation of a new resource
    return response.status(201).send({
      token: paymentToken,
    });
  }
);
```

As you can see there's not a lot of code required to setup an endpoint. We construct a new `Endpoint` using the `Post` class which is extended from the `Endpoint` class. The endpoint name will be exactly the name of your file. So name it what you want your endpoint to be. 

### Testing an Endpoint

To test this out we'll run the following command in the functions folder. 

```tsx
npm run serve
```

This will build the TypeScript code and then serve the functions locally through the emulator. If this is successful you should see the following in the console. You should see the functions API has deployed (locally) a function at the following url 

```tsx
http://localhost:5001/boxtout-fireship/us-central1/users-api
```

All the endpoints in the users resource group will be deployed under the `/user-api` function. This means that we can make a post request to the endpoint with the expected data and check if we get back a result. I'm going to use [PostMan](https://www.postman.com/) to test this out. So we'll put in the above url and add `/addpaymentmethod` at the end of it. Select post as the HTTP request type and then pass in a body.

```json
{
 "card_number" : "5418754514815181",
 "card_holder" : "FilledStacks"
}
```

When we execute this we get back the token in the format we supplied

```json
{
    "token": "5418754514815181_FilledStacks"
}
```

There we have it, your first endpoint created. Next up is reactive functions.

### Creating a Reactive Function

To demonstrate this we'll add a function that will fire when a new user is created in the firestore db. Create a new folder in the users folder called `reactive`. Inside that folder create a new file called `onUserCreated.function.ts` . The part `.function.ts` is very important. That's how we know which file to load as a reactive function. 

```tsx
import * as functions from "firebase-functions";

exports.onUserCreated = functions.firestore
    .document("users/{userId}")
    .onCreate((userSnapshot, context) => {
      const data = userSnapshot.data();
      console.log(
          `User Created | send an email to ${data.email}`
      );
    });
```

Then we'll run `npm run build` in the functions folder. And after that we'll run `firebase emulators:start`. You should now see something like this printed out. You should now have a function deployed at `users-onUserCreated` as well as at `users-api`. All the api endpoints go under the one api function, but the reactive functions are added as their own functions. Lets test this out. 

### Testing out a Reactive Function

At the bottom of your logs you'll see a link to firestore http://localhost:4000/firestore . Open that in your browser. You'll see an empty page. Click on start collection, make the collection id `users` . Add a field called email and put the value dane@filledstacks.com and save the document. When this is saved you should see the logs printing out the following message

```tsx
i  functions: Beginning execution of "users-onUserCreated"
>  User id created TybqxAwnC4X5DWLgtXOp
>  {"severity":"WARNING","message":"Function returned undefined, expected Promise or value"}
i  functions: Finished "users-onUserCreated" in ~1s
>  User Created | send an email to dane@filledstacks.com
```

And that's it! You've created a reactive function as well as a http endpoint. Going further when you want to expand you backend you simply create a new file in the dedicated folder depending on the function type and it'll be added automatically. 

### Environment improvement (This can also fit under Code Setup at the top)

The way that the default TypeScript project is setup is not sufficient for consistent deployments and debugging. Because of that we'll add some additional things into our project. We'll start by making sure that old function code don't lurk around when we're testing any new changes. To fix that we'll add a new package into the functions folder called `rimraf`

```tsx
npm install -d rimraf
```

Then we'll add 2 new scripts into the `package.json` . Above the `build` script we'll add `clean` and `prebuild`.

```json
"scripts": {
    "lint": "eslint --ext .js,.ts .",
    
		"clean": "rimraf lib/",
    "prebuild": "npm run clean",
     
    "build": "tsc",
    "serve": "npm run build && firebase emulators:start --only functions",
    "shell": "npm run build && firebase functions:shell",
    "start": "npm run shell",
    "deploy": "firebase deploy --only functions",
    "logs": "firebase functions:log"
  },
```

This will now clean out your generated code before building the new code.

### Deploy

And finally we can deploy our backend. We first run `npm run build` when that's compelete we run `npm run deploy` and that will push all the latest function code to your firebase project.
